# Sebastian Pritchard-Davies Mandal
Howdy there! Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a full-stack developer. (or at least trying to be) 
I started by watching 6/10/12-hour videos about Python, and then started reading documentation and experimenting by myself.
I've found a love for web development, but I'm flexible and always wanting to learn new things!
